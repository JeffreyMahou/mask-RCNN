# mask-RCNN

Implementation of mask RCNN

There is a copy of the folder mrcnn because in the original mrcnn, there are a lot of outdated tensorflow functions used
I replaced them with up to date functions

The code uses the weights of mask_rcnn_coco.h5 that can be found here https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5

The code uses imagenette data for examples of masks but the classes are not necessarily matching
